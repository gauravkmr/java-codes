In biology, organisms have the following property: Starting from the first cell (the zygote), each cell during an organism's development process either divides into 
2 other cells or does not divide at all. An organism is mature when all of its cells will not divide any further.

Let's assign a unique number to each cell in an organism's development process. For example, consider a species in which each organism starts with cell 0, which divides 
into cells 1 and 2. Cell 1 divides into cells 3 and 4. Cells 2, 3 and 4 do not divide. Every mature organism of this species will consist of exactly 3 cells - 2, 3 and 4.

During the development process, if we kill a cell, it will be absent in the mature form of the organism. If that cell happens to be a cell that divides, then the 
mature organism will be missing all of the cell's descendants as well because the cell is killed before it has a chance to divide. For example, in the organism 
described above, if we kill cell 1 during the development process, the mature organism will contain only cell 2.

You are given a int[] parentCell describing the development process of an organism. The i-th element of parentCell is the parent cell of cell i (where i is a 0-based index). 
The zygote's parent is -1. Return the number of cells the mature form of this organism would have if you killed cell deletedCell during the development process.

Examples
0)	
    	

{-1,0,0,1,1}

2

Returns: 2

This is the example organism from the problem statement. If we kill cell 2, there will still be two cells left (3 and 4).
1)	
    	

{-1,0,0,1,1}

1

Returns: 1

This is the example organism from the problem statement. If we kill cell 1, the only cell left will be cell 2. Cells 3 and 4 will not exist because cell 1 is their ancestor.
2)	
    	

{-1,0,0,1,1}

0

Returns: 0

If we kill the zygote, there is nothing left.
3)	
    	

{-1,0,0,2,2,4,4,6,6}

4

Returns: 2
